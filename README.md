# cowork-mdm

> CLI toolkit for deploying Claude Desktop in the enterprise: MDM config profiles, plugin marketplace management, and per-host diagnostics.

**Status**: pre-release / v0.2 in development. See [docs/execution/TASKS.md](docs/execution/TASKS.md) for current progress.

**Not affiliated with Anthropic.** This project is an independent effort based on reverse-engineering the public Claude Desktop application.

## Why

Anthropic's public enterprise documentation covers **8 of the 51** MDM keys that `Claude.app` actually reads. The remaining keys — `inferenceProvider`, `inferenceBedrockRegion`, `managedMcpServers`, `coworkEgressAllowedHosts`, `bootstrapUrl`, and more — are defined in the app's embedded zod schema (`FJ = me({...})`) but undocumented publicly.

Deploying Claude Desktop in 3rd-party inference mode (Bedrock, Vertex, LLM gateway, Azure Foundry) relies heavily on these undocumented keys. `cowork-mdm` surfaces the schema, generates correct config profiles (`.mobileconfig` / `.reg` / Jamf / Intune formats), manages the org plugin marketplace, and runs per-host diagnostics — so IT admins don't have to reverse-engineer the Electron bundle themselves.

## Quick start

```bash
# macOS (Homebrew)
brew tap krislavten/tap
brew install cowork-mdm

# Or download a binary from the Releases page:
# https://github.com/krislavten/cowork-mdm/releases
```

## Commands

### Schema reference

```bash
cowork-mdm schema list                     # all 51 keys (name, type, scope, appMin)
cowork-mdm schema show inferenceProvider   # details: description, example, legacyAlias
```

### Profile generation

```bash
cowork-mdm profile new                                    # interactive wizard (TUI)
cowork-mdm profile new --template bedrock-mcp             # non-interactive from template
cowork-mdm profile validate my.mobileconfig               # check against schema
cowork-mdm profile export my.mobileconfig --format reg    # convert macOS → Windows
cowork-mdm profile apply my.mobileconfig                  # local dev: sudo cp to /Library/Managed Preferences/
cowork-mdm profile status                                 # what's currently applied
```

### Marketplace management (macOS)

```bash
cowork-mdm marketplace add https://github.com/anthropics/claude-plugins-official
cowork-mdm marketplace update               # git pull all marketplaces + rebuild links
cowork-mdm plugin list                      # per-plugin source + link state
cowork-mdm plugin prune                     # remove dangling symlinks
```

### Diagnostics

```bash
cowork-mdm doctor                           # check plist, pkg, LaunchAgent, AWS creds, app state
cowork-mdm doctor --fix                     # auto-repair what's auto-repairable
```

## Maintainer notes

### Releasing

Releases are tag-triggered. Push a `v*` tag and `.github/workflows/release.yml` runs GoReleaser.

The release job publishes to two places:
1. **GitHub Releases** on this repo — uses the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
2. **Homebrew tap** at `krislavten/homebrew-tap` — requires secret `HOMEBREW_TAP_GITHUB_TOKEN` on this repo. The token must be a personal access token (classic or fine-grained) with **contents:write** on `krislavten/homebrew-tap`. Without it, the brew formula push step fails; everything else (GitHub Release + binaries + checksums) still succeeds.

Set the secret once:
```bash
gh secret set HOMEBREW_TAP_GITHUB_TOKEN --repo krislavten/cowork-mdm
# paste the PAT when prompted
```
